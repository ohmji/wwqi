# Charlie Munger Investment Analysis Framework

This page documents the complete methodology used for systematic investment analysis, based on Charlie Munger's time-tested principles.

## Core Philosophy

> *"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."*
> 
> — Charlie Munger

### Five Pillars

1. **Circle of Competence** - Only invest in businesses you truly understand
2. **Mental Models** - Use multidisciplinary thinking from psychology, economics, physics, biology
3. **Margin of Safety** - Buy quality businesses at significant discounts to intrinsic value  
4. **Long-term Thinking** - Hold great businesses for decades, not quarters
5. **Quality over Quantity** - Concentrate on excellent opportunities rather than diversifying into mediocrity
