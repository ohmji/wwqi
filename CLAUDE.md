## Munger's Timeless Wisdom

### On Worldly Wisdom
*"You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely‚Äîall of them, not just a few. Most people are trained in one model‚Äîeconomics, for example‚Äîand try to solve all problems in one way. You know the old saying: 'To the man with a hammer, the world looks like a nail.' This is a dumb way of handling problems."*

### On Inversion
*"Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don't we want to go, and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how to fail instead‚Äîthrough sloth, envy, resentment, self-pity, entitlement, all the mental habits of self-defeat. Avoid these qualities and you will succeed."*

### On Temperament
*"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting. You're looking for a mispriced gamble. That's what investing is. And you have to know enough to know whether the gamble is mispriced. That's value investing."*

### On Patience & Discipline
*"Our investment style has been given a name‚Äîfocus investing‚Äîwhich implies 10 stocks, not 100 or 400. The idea that it is hard to find good investments, so concentrate in a few, seems to me to be obviously good advice. But 98% of the investment world doesn't think this way."*
