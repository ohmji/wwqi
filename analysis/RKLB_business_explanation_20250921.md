# Rocket Lab Corporation (RKLB) Business Analysis

**Date:** September 21, 2025  
**Ticker:** RKLB (NASDAQ)  
**Current Price:** ~$47.79  
**Market Cap:** $22.83 billion  

## Executive Summary

**Investment Thesis:** Rocket Lab represents a high-quality growth company positioned as the clear #2 player in the U.S. commercial space launch market behind SpaceX. While the business demonstrates strong competitive positioning and exceptional growth metrics, the current valuation at 120x+ revenue multiple offers insufficient margin of safety for Munger-style investing.

**Key Strengths:** Dominant small satellite launch market position, vertical integration moats, strong execution track record, $1B+ backlog providing revenue visibility.

**Primary Risks:** Capital-intensive business model, Neutron rocket execution risk, SpaceX competitive pressure, high valuation requiring perfect execution.

**Recommendation:** HOLD/WATCH - Quality business at full valuation requiring patience for better entry point.
