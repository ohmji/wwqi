## Executive Summary

**Investment Thesis:** Novo Nordisk presents a compelling value opportunity following a 53% stock decline from its peak, trading at attractive multiples (P/E ~15x vs historical 25-30x) despite maintaining dominant market positions in diabetes and obesity care.

## Conclusion

Novo Nordisk represents a classic Munger-style investment opportunity: an excellent business temporarily trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value due to competitive concerns and patent cliff fears. The company's dominant market positions, patent-protected cash flows, and conservative balance sheet provide substantial downside protection, while the GLP-1 market expansion and pipeline development offer meaningful upside potential.

The current market pessimism creates an attractive entry point for long-term investors willing to look beyond near-term competitive noise. With the stock trading at 35-52% below estimated fair value and multiple catalysts on the horizon, NVO merits a high-conviction position for patient capital focused on compound returns over the next decade.

**Final Recommendation:** BUY - Tier 2 Position (5-8% portfolio weight)
