## Executive Summary

**Investment Thesis:** Eli Lilly represents a dominant position in the rapidly growing GLP-1 obesity and diabetes market with exceptional business momentum, but trades at a significant premium to intrinsic value. While the company exhibits world-class execution and competitive advantages, the current valuation of 47-61% above estimated fair value violates Munger's margin of safety principle. Despite strong fundamentals and growth prospects, prudent value investors should wait for a more attractive entry point.

**Recommendation:** HOLD/WAIT - Quality business at premium valuation  
**Fair Value Range:** $405-580 per share (47-23% downside to fair value)  
**Key Catalysts:** Retatrutide data (2025), orforglipron approval, international expansion

## Conclusion

Eli Lilly represents one of the highest-quality pharmaceutical businesses globally, with dominant positions in the rapidly expanding GLP-1 diabetes and obesity markets. The company's clinical superiority, manufacturing scale, pipeline depth, and management excellence create substantial competitive moats that should drive exceptional long-term returns.

However, the stock currently violates Charlie Munger's cardinal rule of investing with a margin of safety, trading 47-61% above estimated intrinsic value. While the business fundamentals are outstanding and growth prospects remain strong, prudent value investors must resist the temptation to pay premium prices for quality businesses.

The current market euphoria around GLP-1 drugs has created an environment where even exceptional companies trade at valuations that offer limited upside and substantial downside risk. Patient capital should wait for a more attractive entry point, likely in the $285-405 range, to achieve the margin of safety necessary for compound long-term returns.

**Final Recommendation:** HOLD/WAIT - Excellent business, excessive valuation
