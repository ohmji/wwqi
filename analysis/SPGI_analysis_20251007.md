## Executive Summary

**Investment Thesis:** S&P Global is a high-quality financial information services company with strong competitive moats, excellent cash generation, and secular growth tailwinds. However, current valuation appears stretched at ~37x P/E, requiring patience for a better entry point.

**Recommendation:** HOLD/WATCH - Quality business trading at premium valuations. Consider accumulating on significant market weakness.

**Position Sizing:** If purchased, would classify as Tier 2 holding (5-8% position) due to valuation concerns despite business quality.

## 📋 Final Investment Recommendation

### HOLD/WATCH - Quality Business, Premium Valuation

**Rationale:**
S&P Global represents exactly the type of business Charlie Munger would admire - dominant market position, wide competitive moats, excellent management, and predictable cash generation. However, at current valuations near 38x earnings, the stock offers limited margin of safety for value-conscious investors.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Add to Watchlist**: Monitor for better entry opportunities
2. **Target Entry Price**: $400-420 (25-30% below current levels)
3. **Allocation If Purchased**: Tier 2 position (5-8% of portfolio)
4. **Monitoring Frequency**: Quarterly earnings, annual report deep dive

**Position Sizing Rationale:**
Despite business quality, current valuation prevents this from being a Tier 1 core holding. Would require 20-25% price decline to justify larger position size.

**Key Monitoring Metrics:**
- Market Intelligence revenue growth and margins
- Ratings issuance volumes and pricing trends  
- Free cash flow generation consistency
- Competitive position vs Moody's
- ESG/Sustainable1 growth trajectory
- Management capital allocation decisions

**Patience Required:** Like all great businesses, S&P Global will occasionally trade at attractive valuations. The current premium reflects market recognition of quality but reduces prospective returns. Better to wait for Mr. Market's inevitable mood swings.
