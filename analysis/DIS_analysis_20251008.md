### 7. Mental Models Application (2-3 hours)

#### Psychology Models Applied
**✓ Incentive-Caused Bias**: Management compensation tied to streaming subscriber growth and park profitability - well aligned with shareholders
**✓ Social Proof**: Disney leverages crowd psychology in parks and viral content marketing
**✓ Authority Bias**: Disney brand represents trusted authority in family entertainment for 100+ years
**✓ Loss Aversion**: Subscription model creates switching costs - customers avoid "losing" content libraries
**✓ Availability Bias**: Recent streaming success may cause overconfidence in digital transition

#### Economics Models Applied  
**✓ Network Effects**: Disney+ benefits from content sharing and recommendation algorithms
**✓ Scale Economics**: $91B revenue enables massive content investments competitors cannot match
**✓ Switching Costs**: High customer loyalty, subscription bundling, merchandise ecosystem lock-in
**✓ Two-Sided Markets**: Theme parks connect visitors with retail/food vendors; streaming connects content creators with audiences
**✓ Creative Destruction**: Streaming disrupting traditional TV, but Disney positioned as disruptor rather than victim

#### Mathematics Models Applied
**✓ Compound Interest**: Disney IP compounds value over decades through multiple monetization channels
**✓ Expected Value**: Multiple revenue streams reduce single-point-of-failure risk
**✓ Base Rates**: Theme park industry historically resilient through economic cycles
**✓ Fat Tails**: Prepared for extreme events (COVID demonstrated resilience and adaptation capability)

#### Systems Thinking Applied
**✓ Feedback Loops**: Successful content drives park attendance drives merchandise sales drives brand strength
**✓ Critical Mass**: Disney has achieved self-reinforcing scale across all business segments
**✓ Redundancy**: Multiple revenue streams provide protection against single segment failure
